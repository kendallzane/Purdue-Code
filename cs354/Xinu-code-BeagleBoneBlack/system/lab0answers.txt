- Task 3 -

Since all three processes were of the same priority, the system attempted to give each one equal time
to execute - which meant that sometimes, priority was switched to a different process mid-print statement.
It seems that priority was being switched while the printed string was being assembled, as the strings started
to meld together where the strings' variables were supposed to be - creating lines that were excessively long,
followed by a single line containg the input character. The only pattern discernable for the order in which
the lines were executed was that no process printed twice in a row - otherwise, it was not predictable which line
would print after another.
