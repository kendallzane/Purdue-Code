1. An interrupt is used by an operating system (such as Xinu) to execute instructions outside of the normal process schedule.
Interrupts are often used for dealing with I/O devices such as keyboards. They are also raised unplanned when an exception occurs
in the execution of a function, such as a divide-by-zero error. They can also be raised by timer functions.

2 - The plan would be as follows:

job2 : 0
job3 : 20
job1 : 80
job4 : 90
job5 : 100

Notably, altering the function in this way allows for all jobs to execute at least somewhat, which is not the case usually.

3 - Each job will execute in the following order, with each quantum being 10 ms:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
3, 4, 5, 
3, 4, 
3, 4,
3, 4,
4

In this case, you can obviously combine the last 2 executions into one job of quantum 20 ms.
