my project correctly implements everything up to 3.10, and 3.15

it does not have edit mode, history, subshells, path completion, .shellrc, or Ctrl-Z implemented

the only real "extra" feature is the shell prompt resembling that of zsh, where it uses some color and prints out relavant ENV variables
(I also included ".." and a basic "about" function

./testall should give 90 points, everything but the subshell part
to my knowledge there shouldn't be any memory issues
